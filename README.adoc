# SolidWire

A solid way to represent https://processwire.com/[ProcessWire] template, fields and relationships.

ProcessWire is a wonderful system with lots of flexibility. In most
cases you donÂ´t need complex hierarchies and relationships to
deliver a great outcome.

However when you are in larger projects some documentation is needed
in order to improve communication between people.

You can use available standards like *UML* or *Entity Relationship Diagrams* to represent
relationships. But they quickly become outdated specially in the first iterations
and drafts. Creating them usually needs some graphic design tool and collaboration
between people become slower.

Other option is to rely on https://modules.processwire.com/modules/migrations/[migrations]. This option has the issue that in most cases, only programmers could understand them.

*SolidWire* was created as a _pseudo code language_ that bridges between code and diagrams.

A tool that is meant to be used as a documentation aid providing an eagle view of _Processwire's hierarchies and relationships_.

Inspiration was taken from different tools and languages like *C*, *UML*, *Markdown*, *Javascript*, *Python*, *PHP*, *Swift*.

## Specification (Version 2.0)

The specs were simplified and are now more _Pseudo code_ like. 
Take this as a framework to build your own conventions.
The idea is to communicate better and provide an eagle view of the _ProcessWire_ project.

## Document

A *Solid Wire* document could have the following extensions:

- *.wire
- *.wd *(Short for wire document)*

## Example

You can use `swift` code tag to highlight the language.

```swift

@document {

    @wire {
        @templates {
            home: template().options({@once, @strong, @root}),
            notfound: template().options({@once, @childless}).description("Used in 404 errors"),
            birds: template().options({@strong}).family({
                    parents: ["home"],
                    children: ["birds-item"]
            }),
            birds-item: template().options({@childless}).family({
                parents: ["birds"]
            })
        },
        
        @fields {
            
            title: text().options({@i18n, @global}),

            body: textarea().options({@i18n}),

            uid: text(),

            href: url(),

            file: files().max(1),

            migration: checkbox(),

            dimorfism: checkbox(),

            size: text(),

            order: text(),

            species: text(),

            image: images().max(1).mediatypes([@jpg, @png, @svg]),

            images: images().mediatypes([@jpg, @png, @svg]),
            
            value: text().options({@i18n}),
            
            habitat: textarea()
                    .description("Stores the habitat property")
                    .options({@i18n}),

            didyouknow: textarea()
                    .description("Stores the did you know property")
                    .options({@i18n}),

            iucn: pagetable()
                    .max(1)
                    .fields({
                        body: body().description("Stores the iucn description"),
                        value: value().description("Stores the iucn value")
                    }),

            audio: pagetable()
                    .max(1)
                    .fields({
                        file,
                        title.label("Author")
                    }),

            map: pagetable()
                .max(1)
                .fields({
                    image,
                    value
                }),
            

        },

        @pages {
            + "Home" (template:home) @many -> {
                + "Birds" (template:birds) @many -> {
                    + "Bird 1" (template:birds-item, fields: {
                        title: title().label("Names"),
                        body: body().label("Description").description("Stores the bird description"),
                        images,
                        habitat,
                        didyouknow,
                        iucn,
                        audio,
                        map,
                        species,
                        migration,
                        dimorfism
                    })
                } // /birds
            } // /home
        } // /pages
    } // /wire
} // /document
```

## Conventions

- `@once`: Only one copy of this page can be created. Alias oof{once:true}.
- `@strong`: Can be deleted only when all the children are deleted. Alias of {strong:true}.
- `@root`: Is the root of the page tree. Alias of {root:true}.
- `@childless`: Can not have children. Alias of {children:false}.
- `@i18n`: Can be multi lang enabled. Alias of {i18n:true}.
- `@global`: This input will be present in every page instance. Alias of {global:true}.
- `@many`: Can have any number of children. Alias of {many:true}.
- `(!!)``: Repeats the last signature used.
- `//`, `/* */` : Comments.
- `""`, `"""` : Strings.

## Cardinality

The cardinality could be defined as `initial..final`. The `*` (asterik) means
"or more". The macro `@many` could be used to write `0..*`. 
You can use any (and only) integer for the initial and final parts.

### Nomenclature

- `0..*`: Zero or more items allowed.
- `@many`: Same as `0..*`.
- `1..!`: One item minimum and maximum.
- `3..!`: Three items minimum and maximum.
- `1..2`: One item minimum, two items maximum.

### Example

- `+ "Birds" (template:birds) @many -> {}`
- `- "Birds" (template:birds) 0..* -> {}`

### Region

Regions are used to specify some area inside the document. Mainly used for
better organization and help tool building.

Is composed by using a comment with the name `Mark:` after it.

- `// Mark: Something`

### Page Reference

Page reference could be called as a component `reference()` or as a
shorthand syntax using `&` symbol.

### Private/Public

- `+` should be used if the pages that would be using this node will have `public` access. (In ProcessWire this means it will have a file named the same as the template).

- `-` should be used if the pages using this node will have `private` access. This is the `default` value if ommited.
